# Machine and Deep Learning for MRI
List of publications on Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) applications.

For now, the publications are alphabetically ordered. In the future, the number of citations will be used.

## Contributing
You can **add / delete / modify** the publications on this list.

#### Addition
Here is an example of markdown code for a paper on the list.

`Distilling the knowledge in a neural network (2015), G. Hinton et al. [[pdf]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531) [[link]](website) [[code]](e.g. github repo)`

The pdf link which can directly download the pdf file rather than links to another webpage is preferred. If the number of authors are more than two, please write the first author's name only.

#### Deletion
If a publication seems to be a duplication of another publication, you can suggest deletion. Deletion is also an important contribution.

#### Modification
Another modification (or Updates) that can usually happen is:
- move publications from a section to another
- correction of typo, grammatical error, etc.
- creation of new sections
